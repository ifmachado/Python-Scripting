This script was automated using Crontab and will run every 12 hours.

To automate using Crontab:
1) Open terminal and type crontab -e, which will open VIM.
2) Type I to insert a new cronjob.
3) Type the following cron command, such as this:

00 */12 * * * /Users/ingridmachado/Documents/ComputerScienceCourse/Scripting/pythonProject2/Assignment2/temp_recorder.py >> ~/cron.out 2>&1

Breaking down the command:
    - 00 */12 * * * is the time and frequency for the schedule in format (minutes, hour, day, month, week).
    * is a symbol for any value and / is the step symbol.
    - path and script to run: /Users/ingridmachado/Documents/ComputerScienceCourse/Scripting/pythonProject2/Assignment2/temp_recorder.py
    - ">>" will save in the specified file the output from the script.
    - ~/cron.out is the log file, which I used to check if the job was running correctly.
    - "2>&1"  redirects Channel 2 (Standard Error) and Channel 1 (Standard Output) to the same place, which will be the log file.

4) Pressed esc to exit editing mode.
5) Typed :wq to save ( w - write) and exit ( q - quit) the VIM.
6) Terminal should display the following message: crontab: installing new crontab

To check the log file:

1) Open terminal
2) Type cat ~/cron.out

GENERAL COMMENTS:
Computer must be on for automation to work.

I added the path (below) for the python 3 interpreter at the top of the file, to make this py file an executable,
so I could use the standard path as the command, instead of the usual python3 file.py command.
# !/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/bin/python3

Due to a few glitches encountered I had to hardcode the paths for database and svg chart.
